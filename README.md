- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelSkaro
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spatial-transcriptomics. My day to day work includes designing, implementing, and deploying containerized Nextflow pipelines on google cloud.
- 💞️ In 2025 I have two personal projects I am embarking on; first, I am interested in GPU acceleration of my omics pipelines. I have spent the last 8 months learning cloud informatics and have noticed the massive inefficencies in CPU only bioinformatics pipelines. Second, I will be incorperating emerging LLM annotations of single cell transcriptomics data sets into routine subworkflows in my single cell pipelines.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am available by email. mskaro.ms@gmail.com or check out my linked in and shoot me a message.
