- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelSkaro
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding cloud based bioinformatics. I have  primarily worked on HPCs for past 8 years. I will be transitioning to primarily working in the cloud, this will present new challenges and opportunities for persoanl growth. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spatial-omics and implmenting massively paralleled Nextflow pipelines. A short term goal will be re-implement familiar workflows in a new domain specific language, containerize and deploy them on a kubernetes. Possible Youtube tutorial incoming 👀 ?  
- 💞️ I’ve finished up loose ends projects for 2023 and will be limiting side projects in 2024. My inbox is always open but I will have limited time this year. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I am available by email. mskaro.ms@gmail.com or check out my linked in and shoot me a message.
